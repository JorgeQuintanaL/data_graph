**DataGraph** is a Python module to generate plots with a defined layout easier. You need to define a layout in a YAML and read it using load_template and DataGraph will do the rest. Some common headers are defined to control some of the aspectsof the plots. It is under a design and development stage and some examples will be added soon.
